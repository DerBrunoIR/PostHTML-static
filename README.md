# PostHTML-static

> [!tip]
> In combination with design agents (like Google Stitch) that output HTML, this template library can be especially useful for fast deployments.

Developing, building, serving and distributing modular websites should be not require shipping heavy JS frameworks.
The JS library PostHTML-include provides an HTML `include` tag for importing other HTML moduls.
Our build script can compile nested HTML moduls into servable HTML files.
Nginx is configured to serve the file tree via HTTP. 
We refer to the served file tree as *dist tree*. 
And the preconfigured docker container is used for distributing the dist tree together with Nginx.

The build script differentiates between components and pages (via the file extension).
- A page can be accessed by users.
- A component can only be accessed if it is directly or indirectly included in a page. 

Example source tree:
```
src
├── blog
│   └── index.page.html
├── components
│   ├── footer.comp.html
│   ├── header.comp.html
│   └── nav.comp.html
├── images
│   └── logo.png
└── index.page.html
```

Resulting dist tree:
```
dist
├── blog
│   └── index.html
├── images
│   └── logo.png
└── index.html

```
Note: Non HTML files, like `images/logo.png`, are also copied to the distributed tree.

## Include Syntax

```html
<!-- relative to importing file -->
<include src="./button.comp.html"></include>
<include src="button.comp.html"></include>
<!-- absolut to projects ./src dir -->
<include src="/components/header.comp.html"></include>
```

See <a href="https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml-include">PostHTML-include</a> for more details, like passing parameters.

## Usage

Build website:
```bash
# setup
npm install # install build.js dependencies

# build pages once
npm run build
# build pages every few seconds. 
npm run dev
```

The docker container is configured to mount the `./dist` directory as a volume.
Therefore, changes in the dist tree are reflected without the need to rebuild the container.
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
For distribution, its recommended to comment the `./dist` volume inside the docker compose file before building the container.
Otherwise, the copied dist tree might not be accessible to Nginx.


## How the building process works?

1. Find all HTML files in `src/`
2. Parse each file to extract `<include>` tags
3. Find a topological ordering; abort if circular
4. Process each HTML file:
   - Inline included components
   - Cache newly built component
5. Write dist tree
